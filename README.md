#Simple Timer in Python
/Description
This project is a simple Python-based timer that allows a user to input a number, and the timer will countdown from that number to 1. Once the countdown reaches 1, the timer ends and notifies the user that the time is up. It demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as user input, loops, and time handling.

/How it Works
1.The user is prompted to enter a number, which represents the start of the countdown.
2.The timer then counts down from the entered number to 1, displaying the remaining time at each second.
3.Once the countdown reaches 1, the timer ends and displays a "Time's Up!" message.
